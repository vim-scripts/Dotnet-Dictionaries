This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=667

In the dictionary-files you find the whole .NET-Framework 4.0 for auto-completion or use in scripts. There are all namespaces, all classes and all functions - at least I hope so.

The entries are organized according to the main dlls. 
E.g. mscorlib.dll becomes mscorlib.dict.

I hope someone invents a good possibilty to use theses entries.
